## Puzzle 3: Data Dilemma

1. **Question**: A patient in your trial reports 'feeling really off and woozy all morning.' According to CTCAE v5, if this is determined to be 'Dizziness' and it's limiting their instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) like driving or shopping, what is the correct grade?
   - **Correct Answer**: b) Grade 2 (Moderate; limiting instrumental ADL)

2. **Question**: To confirm a patient's official cancer diagnosis for trial eligibility, you need to find the definitive pathology report. In a typical EPIC system, which major menu or activity would you most likely navigate to first?
   - **Correct Answer**: c) Chart Review (then likely a 'Media' or 'Pathology/Labs' tab)

3. **Question**: You need to verify the exact start time, stop time, and total volume infused for an investigational product administered yesterday. Which section in EPIC would provide the most accurate and contemporaneous record of these administration details?
   - **Correct Answer**: b) MAR (Medication Administration Record) or an Infusion Flowsheet/Documentation section

4. **Question**: A patient's reported medical history includes 'heart racing really fast sometimes.' If the physician confirms this as 'Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia,' and the protocol requires reporting any cardiac arrhythmias, which term should be officially recorded?
   - **Correct Answer**: c) Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia

5. **Question**: You're reviewing lab results for a patient in your trial. Per the protocol, ALT >3x ULN requires immediate notification. If a patient's ALT is 120 U/L and the lab's ULN is 41 U/L, what action is needed?
   - **Correct Answer**: c) Immediate notification as specified by protocol

6. **Question**: A physician documents 'moderate fatigue limiting some daily activities' in the progress note. When entering this in the EDC system according to CTCAE v5, what grade should be assigned to fatigue?
   - **Correct Answer**: b) Grade 2

7. **Question**: You notice a discrepancy between what a patient verbally reported about medication adherence and what's documented in their pill count log. What is the most appropriate next step?
   - **Correct Answer**: b) Document the discrepancy and discuss with the patient to understand the reason

8. **Question**: A protocol requires monitoring of QTc intervals on ECGs. The most recent ECG report shows a QTc of 481ms, but the previous one was 452ms. According to most clinical trial protocols, this would typically be considered:
   - **Correct Answer**: b) A potentially clinically significant increase requiring follow-up

9. **Question**: When documenting concomitant medications in a clinical trial database, which of the following is the most appropriate way to record a patient taking 'Tylenol as needed for headaches'?
   - **Correct Answer**: b) Record 'Tylenol' with 'PRN' or 'as needed' in the frequency field and 'headache' as indication

10. **Question**: A patient experiences sudden shortness of breath during study drug infusion, which resolves when the infusion is slowed. When entering this event in the EDC, the most accurate classification would be:
    - **Correct Answer**: b) A potential infusion reaction that may be related to study drug
